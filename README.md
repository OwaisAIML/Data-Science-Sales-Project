# Data-Science-Sales-Project
## Sales Data Analysis - 12 Month Report

This project analyzes 12 months of sales data to gain insights into customer behavior and optimize sales strategies.

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the code and analysis for a sales data science project. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from a year's worth of sales transactions to answer key business questions and drive data-driven decisions.

**Data:**

The dataset consists of sales records spanning 12 months, including information such as order ID, product, quantity ordered, price, order date, and purchase address.

**Key Questions Addressed:**

This analysis aims to answer the following critical business questions:

1.  **What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?**
    * This helps identify peak sales periods and understand seasonal trends.
2.  **What city had the highest number of sales?**
    * This reveals geographical sales performance and potential areas for targeted marketing.
3.  **What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying products?**
    * This optimizes advertising timing for increased conversion rates.
4.  **What products are most often sold together?**
    * This enables the implementation of product bundling and cross-selling strategies.
5.  **What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?**
    * This identifies top-performing products and helps understand factors driving their success.

**Methodology:**

The analysis involved the following steps:

* **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating relevant features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing sales trends, identifying patterns, and exploring relationships between variables.
* **Data Aggregation and Calculation:** Calculating monthly sales, city-wise sales, and product-wise sales.
* **Time Series Analysis:** Analyzing sales patterns over time to determine optimal advertising times.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying products frequently purchased together.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Determining the product that sold the most, and forming a hypothesis as to why.

**Results:**

The analysis provides actionable insights into:

* Peak sales months and revenue generated.
* Top-performing cities based on sales volume.
* Optimal times for displaying advertisements.
* Frequently co-purchased products.
* The best-selling product and potential factors contributing to its success.
